## Task: 
Making an email validator, that accepts email addresses where:
- the address has only one '@' 
- neither the username nor the domain part is empty
- the username does not contain any special characters 
- the domain does not contain any special characters
- the domain contains a '.' character but:
    - before the dot char "gmail"; "hotmail" and "freemail" are accepted 
    - after the dot char "hu"; "com" and "de" are accepted
    - plus feature: if "upcmail" is given before the dot char: the program writes a special error message
